RESULTS SUMMARY, INTERPRETATION
 Here I run five different scenarios.
 
 Scenario 1 is reasonably probable "worse" case.  Not worst.  This is using CURRENT EXPANSION RATES.  Beta = 0.42.
   If people do not FURTHER, HARD self-isolate.  Will happen around maybe 50% prob subjective WAG.

   As of Jun  1 evening:
 33,384,799:  Total avoidable deaths from severely ills denied Hosp.BEDS
 12,102,771:  Total avoidable deaths from critically ills denied H.VENTS 
    197,926:  Total deaths of those given proper hospital treatment: 
---------------
 45,685,496:  GRAND TOTAL DEATHS
 
 
 Scenario 2 is unrealistic USA Idyllic Best-Case Scenario, assumes ALL spreading magically stops Wed Mar 25 '20.
 This is the very best case that could possibly happen.  It will never happen.  0% chance.
It's here mostly to provide inspiration, and probably should not have been included:

As of Apr 30 evening:
          0:  Total avoidable deaths from severely ills denied Hosp.BEDS
          0:  Total avoidable deaths from critically ills denied H.VENTS 
     10,967:  Total deaths of those given proper hospital treatment: 
---------------
     10,967:  GRAND TOTAL DEATHS
     
     
Scenario 3 is the best guess at a fairly realistic current scenario, with a moderate level of self-isolation.
Beta = 0.20.  Half the people are strict and stay home with NO contact; half the people sorta do it,
and are still going out to grocery stores etc.  Self-isolation kicks in Mar 25th.  Good chance maybe 40% realistic:

Scenarios 4 and 5 are interesting, because they point out there is a "knee" in the curve,
depending upon how well people self-isolate.  If only 1 in 10 infected people spread to a new person each day,
we are still hosed.  But if merely 1 in 14 infected people spread to a new person each day,
the hospitals are not nearly as jammed up, and millions of people end up surviving.
So immediate, hard isolation will produce substantial results:
